# React Lab

## Description

🚀 React Lab is a collection of experiments, code snippets, and small projects to explore and master React.js. This repository serves as a playground for learning, testing, and implementing various React concepts, patterns, and best practices. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, feel free to dive in, experiment, and contribute!

## What's Inside

- 🧪 **React Experiments**: Fun and practical examples to understand React's core concepts.
- 🧩 **Code Snippets**: Reusable components, hooks, and utilities for everyday development.
- 📂 **Mini Projects**: Small, self-contained projects to practice React in real-world scenarios.
- 📚 **Learning Resources**: Links to articles, tutorials, and documentation for deeper understanding.

## Topics Covered

- React Basics (Components, Props, State)
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)
- Advanced Patterns (Higher-Order Components, Render Props)
- State Management (Context API, Redux, Zustand)
- Routing (React Router)
- Performance Optimization (Memoization, Lazy Loading)
- Testing (Jest, React Testing Library)
